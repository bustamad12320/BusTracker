<h1>Real Time Bus Tracker</h1>

<h2>Description</h2> 

This app uses the mapbox API combined with the SODA API (Austin Public Transit API) in order to periodically pull public bus routes data and displays it on a 
map of the city of Austin. This application updates the location of all bus routes in the Austin area every 15 seconds in order to reliably track buses near the city.

<h2>Instructions on how to run</h2>

This app was built so that it works seamlessly once the site is visited. To run this code simply visit : https://bustamad12320.github.io/BusTracker/.
Alternatively if you want to run this code on your machine you simply need to git clone this repo to your local workspace and open up the index.html file.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

I have really enjoyed working on this project and have a laundry list of all the things I'd like to improve. Below are some of the items in my to do list:

1. Implement a cors proxy server using express that works on every public transit api website for all major cities in the US. I currently got the express cors proxy server to work for the City of Austin but have run into issues with other cities such as Chicago.

2. Incorporate the user's current location to provide bus routes for areas near the user only

3. Smooth out the UI and make it so that the user can click on any given bus route to get more information
