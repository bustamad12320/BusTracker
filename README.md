<h1>Real Time Bus Tracker</h1>

<h2>Description</h2> 

This app uses the mapbox api combined with real time bus data provided by the CTA(Chicago Transit Agency)
As a student at Purdue University I found myself travelling to Chicago quite a bit and noticed how finding 
a real time bus tracking application that fit my specific needs was quite hard to find so I decided to develop one.
